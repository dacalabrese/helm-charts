    description: Bento is a declarative data streaming service that solves a wide
      range of data engineering problems with simple, chained, stateless processing
      steps. It implements transaction based resiliency with back pressure, so when
      connecting to at-least-once sources and sinks it's able to guarantee at-least-once
      delivery without needing to persist messages during transit.
